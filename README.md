# Concentration-Change-Manifold

Manifold for rapid switches of odor concentration using air dilution of the main stream. For each change of concentration, pair of valve solenoids are activated. One of the solenoids deliver air, the second one activate vacuum. On each pair of solenoids we have manual check valves that allows impedance adjustment in air and vacuum lines. To keep total flow constant, we match impedances between each pair of solenoids. Different pairs of needle valves are tuned for different impedances, this way activation of different pair controls different concentration. Vacuum line is under 60 psi pressure (can be reduced). Lee valves can be driven at 5, 12 or 24V.
